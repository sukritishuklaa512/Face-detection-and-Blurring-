# Face-detection-and-Blurring-

- **Created a facial detection and blurring application** using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect and blur faces in real-time or from pre-recorded images and videos, enhancing privacy in multimedia content.
- **Leveraged MediaPipe's Face Detection solution**, using high-accuracy models for efficient face detection and bounding box extraction.
- **Implemented a versatile processing function** that applies selective blurring on detected face regions, preserving the original image while ensuring privacy for facial areas.
- **Supported multiple input modes (webcam, image, and video)** through command-line arguments, adding flexibility for processing different media types.
- **Handled image and video processing with OpenCV**, including real-time display, video writing capabilities, and optimized frame-by-frame processing.
- **Designed an organized output system**, saving processed images and videos to a specified directory, demonstrating proficiency in file handling and project structuring.
